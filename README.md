## Overview
This repository is a collection of artificial intelligence projects, including puzzle solvers, game implementations, and algorithm demonstrations. It is designed for developers and AI enthusiasts who want to explore and learn from various AI concepts and techniques. The projects in this repository are implemented in Java and cover a range of topics, from classic puzzles like Sudoku and Magic Square to more complex problems like the N-Queens problem and the Missionaries and Cannibals problem.

## ✨ Key Features
* 🧩 CryptArithmetic puzzle solver: generates solutions for cryptarithmetic puzzles
* 🎲 MagicSquareTicTacToe game: a combination of Magic Square and Tic Tac Toe
* 🌟 MissionariesAndCannibalsBFS and MissionariesAndCannibalsDFS: solutions to the classic Missionaries and Cannibals problem using Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search
* 🏰 NQueens: a solution to the N-Queens problem
* 🤔 Sudoku: a Sudoku puzzle solver
* 🕹️ TTT_AI_Minimax_AlphaBeta: a Tic Tac Toe game with AI using Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning
